The Coded Enterprise
======================

### Barry Crist

Focus on customer value and velocity. Everything else will follow.


  - Automate everything uniformly

  - Code is the language of collaboration

  - Every change is tested

  - Security and velocity reinforce each other

  - Application choices, then infrastructure choices

  - Narrow the paths to production

  - Continuously create customer value at velocity


### Britney - CARFAX

Gaps between silos need to be eliminated.

  * Duties - we do different jobs
  * Knowledge - we speak different languages
  * Process - we do things differently
  * Empathy - we don't care about what you do


### Barry Crist

Getting there from Infrastructure and Operations

  1 Be marvelous at continuously shipping infra code
  2 Expand this marvelousness to the infra apps that you manage
  3 Then the same for legacy applications
  4 Move towards one path for all apps

Legacy applications aren't scary

  - It is almost always a dependency problem
  - Automation circa 2019 can help with the "modernize and migrate" problem
  - Modern management can encapsulate the application and let you move to a modern platform

The triangle of influence

  - Make sure the CIO/CTO knows about your successes
  - Involve architecture teams
  - Modern application teams should be consuming your infrastructure output

### Cory Scobee - Product Development

Collaboration through code enables groups with different goals to work together.

Code is the path to trust and velocity.

Conversations are easier around concrete implementations.

**Application Layer Cake**

  - Application
  - Middleware
  - Packages
  - System Libraries
  - Operating System

Originally, Chef cookbooks covered all of these - infrastructure centric.

Now, Habitat covers everything except the OS - application centric.
Inspec covers the whole stack.

The best way to build software is to do it in close collaboration with the people who use it.
