### InSpec Cloud Resource Packs

Resource packs are collections of resources that can be leveraged via InSpec profile configuration

Very time consuming to create comprehensive InSpec resources and documentation that correspond to Cloud API endpoints.

### Magic Modules

Automatic generation of InSpec resources and documentation for API platforms

  * Declarative configuration turned into InSpec resources
  * Magic Modules enabled us to rapidly expand InSpec GCP resource coverage
  * POC for migration of previously existing resources complete
  * Aim to continue MM migration and achieve button-press generation of the entire resource pack
